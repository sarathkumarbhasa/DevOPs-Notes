# 🧠 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## 🔹 Definition
**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process that defines all the steps involved in developing software — from **gathering requirements** to **designing**, **coding**, **testing**, **deploying**, and **maintaining** the final product.  

👉 In simple terms, SDLC is like a **roadmap or recipe** for creating software.

## 🧩 Phases of SDLC

| **Phase** | **Purpose** | **Example (E-commerce Website for Clothing Brand)** |
|------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis** | Understand what the client wants and what features are needed. | Decide features like user login, product search, shopping cart, payment gateway, and order tracking. |
| **2. Design** | Plan how the system will look and work — UI/UX and database design. | Create website layouts and design the database (tables for users, orders, products, etc.). |
| **3. Implementation (Coding)** | Write the actual code for the website. | Develop front-end using HTML/CSS/JS and back-end using Python (Flask/Django) or PHP. |
| **4. Testing** | Check the system for bugs and verify all functionalities. | Test login, payments, product filtering, and cart calculations. |
| **5. Deployment** | Launch the software for real users. | Host the website online for public access. |
| **6. Maintenance** | Fix problems, improve performance, and add updates later. | Fix bugs, improve speed, and add new sections like “Discount Offers” or “New Arrivals.” |

## 🔁 Example: Adding a “Discounts Section” (Mini SDLC Cycle)

Whenever a new feature (like **Discounts Section**) needs to be added after launch, we again follow the **SDLC process** — but in a **smaller, faster cycle**:

1. **Requirement Gathering:**  
   Discuss what kind of discounts are needed (percentage, fixed, expiry date, etc.).  
2. **Design:**  
   Plan where to display discounts and how the logic works in the backend.  
3. **Implementation:**  
   Write the code for discount rules, create a database table for offers, and update the frontend.  
4. **Testing:**  
   Ensure discounts apply correctly and payments still work.  
5. **Deployment:**  
   Push the feature to the live server.  
6. **Maintenance:**  
   Fix any bugs and update offers seasonally.  

👉 Even for small updates, SDLC is followed again to maintain **quality and structure**.

## ⚙️ Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)

Modern SDLC integrates these two powerful practices:

- **CI (Continuous Integration):**  
  Developers frequently merge code into a shared repository, automatically tested for errors.

- **CD (Continuous Delivery):**  
  The tested code is automatically deployed to production or staging servers.

✅ Together, **CI/CD** ensures faster updates, fewer bugs, and continuous improvement of the product.

## 🚀 Summary

- SDLC provides a **step-by-step guide** to develop software efficiently.  
- Each phase ensures **clarity, quality, and control**.  
- Even after deployment, any new feature (like *Discounts Section*) follows a **mini-SDLC**.  
- Modern SDLC integrates **CI/CD** for **faster** and **smoother delivery**.
